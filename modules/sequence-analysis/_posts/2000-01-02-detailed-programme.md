**21 – 26 November**

**Aim:** Characterise a novel bacterial pathogen through genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis 

**Overview**

- Instructors will have the original genbank/fasta
- Students will be given simulated short and long reads.
- Instructions for students: 

*An outbreak of diarrhoea has been reported, affecting over a hundred people attending a political conference. Most have fever, severe abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhoea.  Five have been admitted to an ICU and are in a critical condition. You have been presented with the sequencing output from what appears to be an* E. coli *strain that has been isolated from the faeces of one of the ICU patients. Over the coming days you must QC, assemble and annotate the genome sequence from this strain, looking for unusual mobile genetic elements, which should be analysed in depth.*

**Monday 21 November: *Sequence homology and alignment***

09.00. Overview of the day/week 

09.15. Talk (Pallen):  *Sequence Homology: Theory and Practice*

10.00. Instructions for problem-based learning on homology searches (Alikhan, Pallen)

- Exercise: Performance and interpretation of homology searches using NCBI Web BLAST, CDD on illustrative sequences:
  - <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/THD57000.1>
  - <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/WP_086311652.1> 
  - <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/THT06242.1> 
- Advanced Exercise:  Repeat with command line BLAST / HMMer

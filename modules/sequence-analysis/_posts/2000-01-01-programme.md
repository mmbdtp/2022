# From sequence to consequence 

##### Nabil-Fareed Alikhan and Mark Pallen

##### Week 3: 21 – 26 November 2022

Rooms:
* 21/11/22 – UG55 A
* 22/11/22 – UG55 A        
* 24/11/22 – UG55 A
* 25/11/22 – UG44 A
  
Topics include:

* Sequence alignment
* Homology searches 
* Pathogen biology
* Microbial genome annotation
* Microbial genome assembly


> Aim: Characterise a novel bacterial pathogen through genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis

## Overview

- Instructors will have the original genome (GenBank/FASTA) of a novel bacterial pathogen[.](/seq-analysis/teaching) 
- Students will be given simulated short and long reads.
- Students will assemble the genome, assess its quality and characterise the pathogen.

##### Instructions for students

> An outbreak of diarrhoea has been reported, affecting over a hundred people attending a political conference. Most have fever, severe abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhoea.  Five have been admitted to an ICU and are in a critical condition. You have been presented with the sequencing output from what appears to be an *E. coli* strain that has been isolated from the faeces of one of the ICU patients. Over the coming days you must QC, assemble and annotate the genome sequence from this strain, looking for unusual mobile genetic elements, which should be analysed in depth.

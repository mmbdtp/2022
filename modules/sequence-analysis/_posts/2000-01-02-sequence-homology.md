# Sequence homology and alignment

### Monday 21 November

##### 09.00. Overview of the day/week 

##### 09.15. Talk (Pallen):  *Sequence Homology: Theory and Practice*

- [Link to Powerpoint slides](/seq-analysis/Sequence homology_Nov16_1514.pptx)
- [Link to video recording](https://youtu.be/QKK3MM9Xihs)

##### 10.00. Instructions for problem-based learning on homology searches (Alikhan, Pallen)

- Exercise: Performance and interpretation of homology searches using NCBI Web BLAST, CDD on illustrative sequences:
  - <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/THD57000.1>
  - <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/WP_086311652.1> 
  - <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/THT06242.1> 
- Advanced Exercise:  Repeat with command line BLAST / HMMer
- Additional Exercise: Exploring the effect of alignment parameters e.g. gap-penalties using <https://alignment.sandbox.bio/>

##### 11.30. Progress review on problem-based-learning (Alikhan)

##### 13.00. Instructions for problem-based learning on alignment (Alikhan)

- Exercise: [Download and access simulated read data.](/seq-analysis/download-simulated-data)
- Exercise: [Check environment, software, and tools ready for later exercises](/seq-analysis/installing)
- Additional Exercise: [If you're unsure how a computer works, please review Crash Course Computer Science episodes 1 - 20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5nskjZ_GoI&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo&index=2)

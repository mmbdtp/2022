# Genome assembly

###  Tuesday 22 November

##### 09.00. Overview of the day

##### 09.15. Talk (Pallen):  *Microbial Genomics: Theory and Practice*

- [Link to Powerpoint slides](/seq-analysis/Week_3_Talk_Microbial_genomics.pptx)
- [Link to video of the talk](https://youtu.be/R7qbVx3Fu0A)

##### 10.00. Instructions for problem-based learning on genome assembly (Alikhan)

- Exercise: [hybrid and short-read-only assembly of sequenced reads](/seq-analysis/genome-assembly)
- Exercise: [hybrid and short-read-only assembly of sequenced reads (command-line)](/seq-analysis/genome-assembly-cli)

##### 11.30. Progress review on problem-based-learning (Alikhan)

##### 13.00. Instructions for problem-based learning on assembly QC (Alikhan)

- Exercise: [perform QC and compare hybrid and short-read-only assemblies](/seq-analysis/assembly_qc) (using QUAST, webBlast a contig, Kraken, assembly graph with bandage etc.)
- Additional exercise: [Assess the Quality of some other (provided) assembled genomes](/seq-analysis/check_qc). Dataset will include assembled contigs of different strains that fail QC for one reason or another.

##### 16.00. Progress review on problem-based-learning (Alikhan)

# Command Line: First tour

Our main goal is to set up everyone clients,
and to get the main tools to work in the future sessions:
ability to connect to the remote server, using screen to keep
a living session on the remote server.

## ⚠️ Before you start

* Read carefully each paragraph before typing commands.
* Use the *TAB completion*. Always.
* Follow the instructions using the suggested filenames: creativity is not a positive quality for Bash beginners ;)

## Open the Terminal app

In macOS, you can quickly fire up a terminal by opening Spotlight (`⌘ + Space`) and typing `Terminal`,
then pressing *Enter*.

Alternatively, you can open the *Applications* folder, then *Utilities* and double-click on *Terminal*.

:bulb: When you open the Terminal, you can tell macOS to keep the icon available in your Dock.

## First commands

### Where are you?

By default, when you log into a remote machine,
you'll find yourself welcomed in your home directory.
This is a special location dedicated to you, where you can save some files.
On a typical set up its path will be `/home/username/`,
but on complex servers, with many users, this can vary widely.
To check your location, use the `pwd `(print working directory) command:


```bash
pwd
```

Remember that the output will be the _absolute path_ of your current location.

While it might sound strange to have identity problems at your young age, if you use multiple machines it could be that you have more usernames. So if you are unsure about who you are (i.e. what is your current active username):

```bash
whoami
```

To quickly go (or return) to our home directory, the command is simply:

```bash
cd
```

Create an empty file with your name in your home using the _touch_ command:

```bash
touch ~/AndreaTelatin.txt
```

### Downloading the repository

After going to our home, let's download (actually, *clone*) the repository with 
the exercise files with this command:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/telatin/learn_bash.git
```

Did we download something? Try the ls (list) command to see:

```bash
ls
```

We can also add a first switch to this command: to view more details use the -l (long) switch:

```bash
ls -l
```

What does the learn_bash directory contains?

```bash
ls -l learn_bash
```

and so and forth..

```bash
ls -l learn_bash/files/
```

### The shell prompt

Now that you tried the first commands, let's make a step back. The linux shell has a string to tell you it's ready to receive commands. The string is called shell prompt, and can be very minimal, like a simple $, or a more complex thing. As you can guess, it's something we can customize. Usually has a structure like:

```bash
telatin@gmh:~$
```

That is: `username` @ `machine name` : `current directory` $

The last character is conventionally a dollar sign ($) for regular users, and a sharp (#) for super-user (administrators). In Linux there is only one administrator called root, but some users could have the privilege to impersonate root from time to time.

Also note that the tilda (~) is a shortcut for your home directory.

Remember that you have to wait to see the shell prompt before issuing new commands. If you don't see it, maybe the previous command is stuck or simply still working.

### Navigating the filesystem

Now try changing directory, that means setting a new working directory:

```bash
cd /tmp
```

Did it work? Test with pwd.

To return quickly to the home directory, you can use `cd` without specifying the destination path:

```bash
cd
```
Now we are back to our home directory. So we can create a new sub-directory called course:

```bash
mkdir course
```

### Using the manual for a command

Bundled with your distribution there is a manual. It's useful to know that is there, but it's even more useful understanding how to use it as we'll see that another very handy shell command has the very same behaviour.

The manual command is man, followed by the command:

```bash
man ls
```
When launching the manual, you'll enter an interactive page. You can:

* Scroll using the arrow keys, or “Page Up” and “Page down”, or the space bar to scroll down one page
* `g` will go quickly to the beginning of the document, `G` to the end 
* `/` enable a serch inside the document: type “/”, a string and then ENTER.
* After a search `n` will jump to the next occurrence, `N` to the previous.   
* :warning: Finally, `q` to quit. You will get your prompt back.

## Text files

Our repository contains several files.

### The *cat* command

The `cat` command is used to display the content of a file. Its name comes from *concatenate*,
as it is - in fact - able to concatenate multiple files one after the other.

Try with a file from our repository:

```bash
cat learn_bash/files/introduction.txt 
```

### Peeking with *head* and *tail*

Some times files are large, or even impossibly large, and we save our sanity if we just
print the first (or last) lines of a file. The `head` and `tail` commands are used for this purpose.

```bash
# Display the first 10 lines of the file
head learn_bash/files/introduction.txt 
```

By default both `head` and `tail` print the first 10 lines of a file. 
You can change this behaviour by adding the `-n NUMBER` parameter, for example:


```bash
# Display the last line of the file
tail -n 1 learn_bash/files/introduction.txt 
```

:bulb: try concatenating two files with `cat FILE1 FILE2`.

### Matching patterns with *grep*

The `grep` command is used to search for a pattern in a file. 
It is a very powerful tool, and it is used in many other commands. 
The pattern can be a simple string, or a 
[regular expression](https://towardsdatascience.com/regular-expressions-clearly-explained-with-examples-822d76b037b4).

```bash
# Print the lines containing the pattern 'darwin'
grep darwin learn_bash/files/introduction.txt
```

You will see *no output*, as no lines contains that pattern. Capitalizing *Darwin* will work, or we can 
add the `-i` switch to ignore case:

```bash
grep -i darwin learn_bash/files/introduction.txt
```

### Counting lines with *wc*

The `wc` command is used to count the number of lines, words and characters in a file.
By default it prints the number of lines, words and characters in the file, or you can just 
print the lines adding the `-l` switch.

```bash
# Count the lines in the file
wc -l learn_bash/files/*.txt
```

:bulb: in the previous command we used a wildcard character: `*`, that means "any set of characters". 
How many files did you find ending by *.txt* in the *files* subdirectory?

### The *less* command

The `less` command is used to display the content of a file *in an interactive way*, 
and unlike other commands it allows you to scroll through the file, and search for patterns.
Its name comes from *less is more*, as it is a more powerful version of the `more` command.
It works as the `man` command (same keys to scroll, search, quit).

```bash
# The -S switch is used to avoid line wrapping
less -S learn_bash/files/origin.txt
```

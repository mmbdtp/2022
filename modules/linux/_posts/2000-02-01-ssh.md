# SSH Connections 

A Linux computer (including servers and virtual servers) have a *command line interface* (CLI) to interact with files and programs. The command line is very convenient, and it is in fact very user friendly to perform repetitive tasks, much more than a point-and-click interface that would force you to repeat tasks with the risk of introducing errors in the procedure.

**SSH (Secure Shell)** is a protocol that allows you to connect to a remote computer and use its command line interface. It is a very powerful tool that allows you to run programs on a remote computer, transfer files, and even run graphical programs on a remote computer. 

When we log in to a remote computer, we become a different user in a different machine, with access to different files.

## Accessing a remote server from a termina, using a password

üí°  _Remember_: you need three things to log in: the **remote address**, your remote **username** and your remote **password**.

We can access a remote server only if we have a user account inside that server, and of course we need to know the address of the remote server. For this example let's suppose that our username is _ubuntu_ and that the remote server has this address _147.188.173.69_.

If your local computer already has a UNIX terminal (e.g. all Macs and all Linux computers have one), you can use your local terminal to connect to the remote machine.

In OS X you'll find the Terminal application inside the Applications folder, and can fire it up using Spotlight and typing ‚ÄúTerminal‚Äù. When the terminal is open, type the command:

`ssh username@machine`

If this is the first time you try to access a new server, then you'll get a message like this:

```
The authenticity of host '<server name>' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:H5D4SW4xqEMp6TJCtDR76xxc5h+7bW4bvBP4r9rQ9jM.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

You can safely type `yes` and then hit Enter.

:warning: You'll be prompted to enter the password. 

Type it __very carefully__ (as errors could prevent us to go on with the practical) and be aware that 
**you won't see asterisks or dots** ‚ùó while you type. Just hit enter at the end.

## Accessing a remote server from a termina, using a key file

Key files are more secure than passwords, and when we generate a *private key* (analogous to a physical key), we 
also generate a *public key* (analogous to the key hole for that key).

We can ask the server administrator to add our *pulic key* to the server so that we can enter using the *private key*,
without having to enter a password.

1. **Generate the Key file**: if we don't have one already, the command is `ssh-keygen -t rsa`. This will
create a file called `id_rsa` (the private key) and a file called `id_rsa.pub` (the public key), both in the `~/.ssh/` folder.
2. **Logging in**: if we use the default key we can simply `ssh username@hostname` and we will enter. If we need to specify the key file, we can use the `-i` option, e.g. `ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa username@hostname`.
   
## Terminal emulator for Windows

![PuTTY]({{site.baseurl}}/img/putty.png)

There is a free terminal emulator for Windows called [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), that we can [download](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty.exe) and launch to access the remote machine. Once launched we just need to type `username@machine_address` in the appropriate form field and then

If this is the first time you try to access a new server, then you'll get a message like this:

```
The authenticity of host '<server name>' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:H5D4SW4xqEMp6TJCtDR76xxc5h+7bW4bvBP4r9rQ9jM.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

You can safely type yes and then hit Enter.

:warning: You'll be promted to enter the password, note that you will not see any character while typing.

Type it very carefully (as errors could prevent us to go on with the practical) and be aware that you won't see asterisks or dots while you type. Just hit enter at the end.

Now you have a Terminal session like any other, just inside a Windows program.

# GNU Screen

Using "screen" to save your remote sessions

## Why?

A typical problem when connecting to a remote machine is that if the connection drops,
the remote server will believe we are no longer interested in it and will kill our session.
If we were performing some analysis, it will be terminated and we'll have to run it again.

Sometimes the analysis is long, and even if we have a stable connection
we would need to keep our computer on just to let the remote server knowing
we don't want to close the session.
There is a handy tool to make our life easier: `screen`.

With `screen` we can create a terminal that will not disappear
when we disconnect from a machine, and that will wait for us
to come back when reconnecting to the server.

## How?

In this section we'll see how to
(1) create a new working session,
(2) how to connect to an existing session and
(3) some tricks to use screen as a pro. 

### To create a screen session

* Log in into the remote machine.
*  First of all, we have to check no other screen session is active:
     `screen -list`

* If the previous command gives no output (or a message like *No Sockets found in ‚Ä¶*), then we can create a new screen
*  To create a new screen session, type this command:
    `screen -S course`. With the `-S` switch we gave our session a handy nickname (‚Äúcourse‚Äù),
    it's not mandatory to do so, but can be very helpful.
* Now we are inside our ‚Äúscreen‚Äù and we'll have to press ENTER to get rid of a welcome text.
  If we close the terminal window, we don't lose what we were doing.

### To reconnect to an existing screen session

* To re-attach to our previous screen:
    `screen -dr course`

### Interacting with the screen program

Since the screen program shows us a Linux terminal, when we type we are talking to the terminal itself. So to interact with screen we need a special shortcut: `Ctrl + A`. This triggers screen to listen to us. Then we can type a second key to specify what we needed:

 * `Ctrl + a`, `c` to **c**reate a new terminal inside our session
 * `Ctrl + a`, `p` to navigate to the **p**revious terminal
 * `Ctrl + a`, `n` to navigate to the **n**ext terminal
 * `Ctrl + a`, `d` to **d**etach from the session: we'll return back to the ‚Äúparent‚Äù terminal where we can reattach to the screen session with screen -r course.

# Setup your Mac

> We will update this page toghether, as new Macs can require specific tweaks. I have an M1 Mac but I did the setup some months ago...

Most of the bioinformatics happens in a Linux server, but MacBooks are great clients for bioinformatics
also because their operating system is Unix-based. 

:bulb: In macOS, you can quickly fire up a terminal by opening Spotlight (`âŒ˜ + Space`) and typing `Terminal`,
then pressing *Enter*.

## Install Rosetta

If you have an M1 Mac, you need to install [Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT211861).
This is a software that allows you to run Intel-based applications on your Mac.

Open a terminal and type:

```bash
softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
```

Now we can configure our Terminal to be executed under rosetta, which can make our life easier:

1. Locate the Terminal application in the Finder
2. Right-click and select `Get Info`
3. Tick the checkbox `Open using Rosetta`

## Install the command line tools

A lot of advanced tools benefits from the presence of a compiler, to build programs
from source. 

From the terminal, type:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

## Install Homebrew

The most used package manager for bioinformatics is "Miniconda", and we will see how to install it also on our Mac.
A nice trick to super-charge our terminal experience is to install also Homebrew, which can be considered as the "super environment" with all the utilities we would install with "apt-get" in a Linux server.

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) allows you to install software easily and quickly. 

## Install Java

We can now use Homebrew to install Java:

```bash
brew install openjdk
```

Check that Java is installed:

```bash
java -version
```

## Install Miniconda

See [Installing conda (and mamba)](https://telatin.github.io/microbiome-bioinformatics/Install-Miniconda/)

:warning: selecting **Miniconda3 macOS Intel x86 64-bit** and **not** the M1 version!

## Install Visual Studio Code

VS Code is a fantastic text editor, and it's available for Mac, Windows and Linux.
I recommend installing the *Intel Chip* version even for M1 Macs, to make use of the
Intel-based tools from the terminal.

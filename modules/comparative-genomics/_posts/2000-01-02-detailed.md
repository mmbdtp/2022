# Comparative Genomics 

Instructors: Dr Gemma Langridge, Dr Andrew Page 

## Monday: Mapping and variant calling  

* Lead instructor: Gemma 

* Dataset: A set of *Salmonella enterica* serovar Typhi samples that have been sequenced at QIB. 

* Task: Compare the results of using short and long read sequencing to map to a reference. What is similar, what is different and what impact does this have on the overall interpretation?

What isn't included when you do analysis using a reference genome?  Is it important and what does it do? 

How do you choose a reference to use?  

9:00-10:00 -- Introduction and setup of task 

10:00-12:00 -- Task 

13:00- 15:00 -- Task 

15:00-16:30 -- Talk from Dr Marie Chattaway, UKHSA (plus Q&A)

16:30-17:00 -- Wrap up 

## Tuesday: Pan-genomes and mobile genetic elements 

* Lead instructor: Andrew 

* Task: Construct a pan-genome of the dataset. What is core to all of the genomes and what is accessory. What is actually in the accessory genome, what do the genes do and why does it matter? How do you tell between a mis-assembly, an integron, a plasmid etc... 

 9:00-10:00 -- Introduction and setup of task 

10:00-12:00 -- Task 

13:00-16:00 -- Task 

15:30-16:30 -- Talk from Dr Muhammad Yasir 

16:30-17:00 -- Wrap up 

## Thursday:  Genome comparison 

* Lead instructor: Gemma 

* Dataset: Same as Monday 

* Task: Can you identify and visualise large structural variation?  Why is this important?  

Can you identify large insertions and deletions? What genes are impacted?
Can you distinguish between an informatics artefact and a real signal? 

 9:00-10:00 -- Introduction and setup of task 

10:00-12:00 -- Task 

13:00-16:00 -- Task 

15:30-16:30 -- Talk from Dr Emma Waters  

16:30-17:00 -- Wrap up 

## Friday: Outbreak investigations 

* Lead instructor: Andrew 

* Dataset: [Salmonella_enterica_1203NYJAP-1.tsv](https://github.com/WGS-standards-and-analysis/datasets/blob/master/datasets/Salmonella_enterica_1203NYJAP-1.tsv)

* References:
  * [academic.oup.com/jid/article/213/4/502/2459204](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/213/4/502/2459204?login=true) 
  * [peerj.com/articles/3893/](https://peerj.com/articles/3893/)

* Task: This is a dataset from a real outbreak investigation. Time is critical. Are the samples linked? What information can you find out about these samples to aid the epidemiologists?

13:00-16:00 -- Task 

15:30-16:30 -- Talk: *SARS-CoV-2 molecular epi case studies* (Andrew) 

16:30-17:00 -- Wrap up

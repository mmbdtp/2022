# Downloading simulated data 

*Reads are available at [https://zenodo.org/record/7245398](https://zenodo.org/record/7245398)*

You can directly download them with wget or similar. 

```
wget https://zenodo.org/record/7245398/files/novel-pathogen-long-reads.fastq.gz
wget https://zenodo.org/record/7245398/files/novel-pathogen_R1.fastq.gz
wget https://zenodo.org/record/7245398/files/novel-pathogen_R2.fastq.gz
```

The files are compressed (.gz) FASTQ files. 

FASTQ format is a text-based format for storing both a biological sequence (usually nucleotide sequence) and its corresponding quality scores. Both the sequence letter and quality score are each encoded with a single ASCII character for brevity.

It was originally developed at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute to bundle a FASTA formatted sequence and its quality data, but has recently become the de facto standard for storing the output of high-throughput sequencing instruments such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer

There are three files: 

* Short read R1 - [novel-pathogen_R1.fastq.gz](https://zenodo.org/record/7245398/files/novel-pathogen_R1.fastq.gz)
* Short read R2 - [novel-pathogen_R2.fastq.gz](https://zenodo.org/record/7245398/files/novel-pathogen_R2.fastq.gz) 
* Long reads - [novel-pathogen-long-reads.fastq.gz](https://zenodo.org/record/7245398/files/novel-pathogen-long-reads.fastq.gz)

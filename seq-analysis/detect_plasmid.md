#### About PHASTER

Annotation
* Glimmer, tRNAscan-SE, ARAGORN
* DBSCAN for finding clustered genes
Finding prophages
* At least four viral genes
* Cumulative length of the gaps between component clusters
* Number and proportion of genes matching known prophage genes
* Presence of blast hits that match a high proportion of a particular phage strain’s known genes
* Presence of IS and viral genes with key functions including integrases transposases, and structural genes.
